\begin{document}
The goal of a discourse is to identify the actual situation, and situations are identified by the propositions which are true in them.
I assume, following \textcite{buring1999topic}, that discourse is best modelled as a tree with non-terminal nodes representing questions and terminal nodes representing answers.

A binary branching discourse tree would work as follows.
Each question represents a strict partition of it's domain.
For instance the question \textit{What did the pop-stars wear?} partitions the domain of wearable things into \textit{things the pop-stars wore} and its complement \textit{things the pop-stars didn't wear}.
An answer of \textit{sunglasses} would partition the former subdomain into the singleton set containing \textit{sunglasses} and its complement \textit{other things the pop-stars wore}.

To see what this system rules out, consider the following scenario.
The domain of individuals is $\left\{ \text{Emily, Arsalan, Paula} \right\}$


Consider the increasing acceptability of the following specificational clauses:
\ex.
\a.\label{ex:bad}\# A figure is Eric Lenneberg.
\b.\label{ex:so-so}\#? A figure in the history of Generative Grammar is Eric Lenneberg.
\b.\label{ex:good} An underrated figure in the history of Generative Grammar is Eric Lenneberg.
\z.

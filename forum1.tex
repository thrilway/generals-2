\ex. OK, let's begin.
We have a lot riding on this job, so please be very careful and make no mistakes.
If we succeed at what we are trying to do, the benefits will be enormous.
\textbf{But we all know the consequences if we fail.} \hfill (\cite{lasersohn1996adnominal})

\ex.
\a. The fine if you park in a handicapped spot is higher than the fine if your
meter expires.
\b. The price if you pay now is predictable; the price if you wait a year is not.
\c. The outcome if John gets his way is sure to be unpleasant for the rest of
us. \hfill (\cite{lasersohn1996adnominal})

\ex. $\llbracket$We all know the consequences if we fail$\rrbracket \neq \llbracket$If we fail, we all know the consequences.$\rrbracket$

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{The outcome if John gets his way} is the outcome in all the closest worlds to the actual world in which John gets his way.

\ex.The Lost Highway Scenario (variation from von Fintel \& Heim 2011)\\
Mary and Susan in the car. Susan driving, Mary in the car. They donâ€™t know for sure where they are. However, they do know the following:\\
a. They are either on Route 87 or Route 91\\
b. They have passed a park.\\
Mary checks the map and sees the following pictures:\\

\begin{itemize}
	\item Given this, the following utterance if made by Mary is judged false:

\ex. A possible destination if we're on Route 91 is Lockhart.

In the previous section, I argued that the restriction on indefinite SC subjects was due to a requirement that SC subjects contain but not be CT marked constituents.
In this section I will argue that, rather than being a parochial constraint, this requirement can be derived from a more general constraint on CT-Foc structure.
The general constraint I will propose, is that in addition to contrastive/new information, as marked by CT and Foc intonation, CT-Foc structured utterances require given/presupposed material.

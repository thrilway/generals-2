\begin{document}
\ex.\label{bad} To be explained:
\a.\# A figure is Eric Lenneberg.
\b.\# A doctor is Mary.

\ex.\label{ct} $\llbracket$A doctor is Mary$\rrbracket^{CT}=$\\
$\left\{ P | \left\{ x | P(x) \right\}  \right\}$

\ex.\label{qud} QUD(A doctor is Mary) = Who is what?

\begin{itemize}
	\item From last time: \ref{bad} is infelicitous because it implies \ref{qud}, which is an illicit question.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Why is it illicit?
		\end{itemize}
	\item It seems to put everything under discussion.
	\item No discourse exists in a vacuum, though.
	\item Some answers to \ref{qud} will be included in the context.
\end{itemize}
\ex. Informal hypothesis:\\
A question \textit{q} is felicitous in a discourses only if there is no assertion \textit{a} such that \textit{a} is a partial answer to \textit{q}

\ex. Consider:\\
A: What did the pop-stars wear?\\
B: The \textsc{female} pop-stars wore \textsc{caftans}.\\
A: \# But, What did the pop-stars wear?
